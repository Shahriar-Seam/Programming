# Contributing to Competitive Programming Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this competitive programming repository! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Found a bug in a solution? Open an issue with:
  - Problem name and platform
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Input/output examples if applicable

### 2. Suggesting Improvements
- Alternative solutions with better time/space complexity
- Code optimization suggestions
- Documentation improvements

### 3. Adding New Content
- New problem solutions
- Additional test cases
- Algorithm implementations
- Tutorial content

## üìù Submission Guidelines

### Code Style
- **C/C++**: Follow existing formatting patterns
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines  
- **Comments**: Include problem statement or link
- **Variable Names**: Use meaningful, descriptive names

### File Organization
- Place solutions in appropriate platform directories
- Use consistent naming: `problemID.cpp`, `problemName.py`
- Include input/output examples in comments when helpful

### Solution Requirements
- Solutions should be correct and tested
- Include time and space complexity in comments
- Add brief explanation for complex algorithms
- Use efficient algorithms appropriate for constraints

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

When adding new content, follow the existing structure:

```
Platform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contest_Name/          # For contest solutions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Problemset/           # For practice problems
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Topic_Name/           # For topic-specific content
```

## ‚úÖ Before Submitting

1. **Test Your Solution**
   - Verify correctness with sample inputs
   - Test edge cases when possible
   - Ensure it passes time limits

2. **Check Code Quality**
   - Remove debug statements
   - Add necessary comments
   - Follow naming conventions

3. **Verify File Placement**
   - Correct directory structure
   - Appropriate file naming
   - No duplicate solutions

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b add-new-solution`
3. Make your changes following the guidelines above
4. Commit with descriptive messages
5. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## üìã Pull Request Template

When creating a pull request, include:

- **Problem Details**: Platform, problem ID/name, difficulty
- **Solution Approach**: Brief algorithm description
- **Complexity**: Time and space complexity
- **Testing**: Mention any testing performed

Example:
```
Add Codeforces 1234A solution

- Platform: Codeforces
- Problem: Two Arrays And Swaps (1234A)
- Approach: Greedy algorithm with sorting
- Complexity: O(n log n) time, O(1) space
- Tested with sample inputs and additional cases
```
